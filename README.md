# Cyclops Reader

> Cyclops is an Hacker News reader with a focus on simplicity.

It provides a small set of features:

* Dark & Light mode
* Bookmarks
* Customizable feed length
* Toggleable post stats
* Personal stats

And a set of anti-features:

* No infinite scroll — for obvious reasons
* No comments — shielding you from *other* people's bad opinions
* Harder to reach buttons — to discourage you from going to the next page non-stop
